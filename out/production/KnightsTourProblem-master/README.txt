Run:
<LEFT>
"Solve Knight's Tour" runs the backtracking algorithm and 
prints the solution to the text and grid views.  
"Animate Algorithm" updates the grid display for each pass
of the algorithm, so you can see how it executes.
"Animate Solution" runs the algorithm and only animates
the final solution.
